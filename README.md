For executing the code you need to run the cells sequentially in the ipython notebook file(s) present in the repository.

You can run the cells of the notebook(s) by two methods:
1. Google Colab (Recommended)
2. Locally

#### 1. Google Colab (Recommended)
1. Download the notebook file (SEP_769_CPS_DL_Water_Quality_Project_G9_COLAB.ipynb) on your local system.
2. Download the dataset file (water_potability.csv) on your local system.
3. Using your browser open google colab.
4. Upload the files (notebook file and dataset file) on google colab file system / drive.
5. Update the path to the dataset in the notebook.
6. Execute the cells sequentially.

#### 2. Locally
1. Download the notebook file (SEP_769_CPS_DL_Water_Quality_Project_G9_LOCAL.ipynb) on your local system.
2. Download the dataset file (water_potability.csv) on your local system.
3. Place both of the downloaded files (notebook file and dataset file) in the same folder.
4. Start the jupyter notebook program locally and locate the downloaded files.
5. Update the path to the dataset in the notebook.
6. Execute the cells sequentially.

Note: If required, install the required packages by executing <code> pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt </code> in the terminal/shell.
